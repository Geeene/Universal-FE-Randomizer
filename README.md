# Custom variant of the Yune Randomizer. See Yune [here](https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer)

## Main Goals of this Custom Build:
Randomized Promotions âœ“ Done, needs some more testing though.<br>
Shuffling Arbitrary Units into GBA FE games. I have a somewhat working implementation, but it's really bugy.<br>

### Smaller Changes
Add Extra Units to FE6 (Trial Map Characters)<br>

I will probably not do anything with regards to FE4 / 9.<br>
