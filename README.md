# Yune: A Universal Fire Emblem Randomizer

# Latest Version: [0.9.3](https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer/releases/tag/0.9.3)

## Introduction

Properly universal this time. Those of you that used the original may recall that it supported all the GBA FEs, but was locked to Windows machines, mostly because I wrote it in Visual Basic, which has zero cross compatability. This time around, we're taking the opposite approach and starting with a single game first, but working on the three major desktop platforms.

And hey, name change! It's actually perfect in a lot of ways because it encapsulates several of my favorites. Alongside Fire Emblem, I'm also a fan of Love Live! with my favorite girls being Minami Kotori in Î¼'s and Takami Chika in Aqours. Kotori's symbol reflects her name: Little Bird. Chika's associated color is Orange, alongside her symbol, a Mikan (tangerine). Combine these two to get an Orange Little Bird, which leads me to my favorite Fire Emblem character, which, if you couldn't tell already, was Micaiah from Radiant Dawn. Yune is the name of the orange little bird she has with her in most of her art. And without wishing to spoil those who haven't played Radiant Dawn, there is another way Yune is fitting for the name of a randomizer, but I'll leave that to you, because if you haven't played Radiant Dawn, you really should.
